# Welcome!

Welcome to the official website for Microcontrollers' Alternatives lists!

To find a list, use the navbar at the top of the page if on PC or in the left sidebar menu on mobile.
Lists are separated by Minecraft version and then category (client/mod/modpack) within that.

## For potential contributors

Looking to contribute something to the project?

* Please make all your changes in a feature branch instead of main
* Follow the style that everything else is using in that specific list or follow the general style in other lists if creating a new one
* Make sure that the option that lets us make changes to your pull request is enabled
* If you are going to update/add a mod, make sure that you change/add it on every list where applicable
* We reserve the right to cherrypick changes and add them ourselves (with due credit to you)
* Add your name to credits in alphabetical order in edited lists and in contributors.md, even for the tiniest of change
* Preferably link to your GitHub account, though you may link to something else if you wish

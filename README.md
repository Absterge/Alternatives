# Alternatives

## Description

This repo contains many alternatives to poorly made clients, mods, and modpacks.  
Anybody may use this repo for their own work as long as credit is properly given in the form of my name and a link to this repo.

## For Contributors:

- Follow the style that everything else is using in that specific list
- Make sure that the option that lets me make changes to your pull request is enabled
- If you are going to update/add a mod, make sure that you change/add it on every list where applicable
- I reserve the right to cherrypick changes and add them myself (with due credit to you)
- Add your name to credits in alphabetical order, even for the tiniest of change
  - Preferably link to your GitHub account, though you may link to something else if you wish

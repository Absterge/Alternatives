## Replace

- [**Canalex's Keystrokes with Sk1er's**](https://sk1er.club/mods/keystrokesmod)
  - Old and no longer maintained. Sk1er's will continue to receive updates once Essential is fully released.
- [**spiderfrog's old animations with Sk1er's**](https://sk1er.club/beta)
  - Spiderfrog's OAM causes many issues with other mods, is bloated, and causes crashes. Sk1er's is more accurate to 1.7 with better compatibility and no bloat.
- [**Powns's ToggleSneak with Lily's SimpleToggleSprint**](https://github.com/My-Name-Is-Jeff/SimpleToggleSprint/releases/latest)
  - Powns's ToggleSneak is no longer maintained and has some small issues that Lily's fixes.

## Remove

- **ModCore Container**
  - Modcore Container was a mod meant to give players ModCore before it was packaged in mods that needed it, therefore making ModCore Container no longer in use.
- **Player API**
  - Player API is no longer used in any mods.
- **AutoWho**
  - Hypixel removed AutoWho's core functionality a few years ago.
- **Skypixel**
  - Skypixel is old, not maintained, and has many features that are either useless, or simply do not work anymore. It will cause issues on Skyblock.
- [**LabyMod**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/blob/main/LabyMod.md)
  - LabyMod causes many issues with other mods, and has many alternatives that can be used without messing up other mods.
- [**SkyblockExtras**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/blob/main/SkyblockExtras.md) (if you bought it)
  - SBE breaks EULA, breaks some licenses, leads to poor FPS, and has much better free alternatives for all of its important features.

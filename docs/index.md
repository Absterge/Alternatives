# Welcome!

You can find links to every alternatives
page in the navbar at the top of this page.
Click on one to select the alternatives list
you're looking for.

## For potential contributors

* Please make all your changes in a feature branch instead of main/master
* Follow the style that everything else is using in that specific list
* Make sure that the option that lets me make changes to your pull request is enabled
* If you are going to update/add a mod, make sure that you change/add it on every list where applicable
* I reserve the right to cherrypick changes and add them myself (with due credit to you)
* Add your name to credits in alphabetical order, even for the tiniest of change
* Preferably link to your GitHub account, though you may link to something else if you wish

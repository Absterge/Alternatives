# Todo List

## Feather Client

* Move external mods into respective version categories
* Figure out what to do about unrecommended mods (ie OptiFabric, DSM)
* Make SkyClient and Argon messages nicer and maybe move to bottom.
* Forge/Fabric install guides? Maybe link to Lizzy's for Forge and MigratingToLatest for Fabric
* Figure out what to do about Feather missing mods for some versions (i.e., no Patcher 1.12)
patcher in specific is solved by Patcher being included in the general settings anyways, need to find out if anything else has the same issue)
Make a final decision on 1.17. I don't see any reason to support it here, who is still playing 1.17?

Reasoning: SBA has not recieved a new update in over a year and is locked behind a paywall, only given to donators. It has come to the point where SBA 1.5 has very few features that haven't been replaced/outshined by other mods, and the same is mostly true with the 1.6 betas. The mod has begun to feel like a cash grab in which no development is made but people only buy for its well known name. Therefore, I plan to make an alternatives list to help prevent people for paying for something that doesn't recieve updates. This will be split into two sections, one for 1.6 features, and one for 1.5 features as well since there is not much of a point to continue using this mod.

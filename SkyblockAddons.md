# WARNING

This list is in no way even closed to finished and should not be shared; this is still being created and will not be organized for a while. It also may be removed at any time due to the sheer amount of features in SBA that do not/will not have an alternative in the near future, or be shortened to only 1.6 beta specific features

## yes

Reasoning: SBA has not recieved a new major update in over a year (estimate) and is locked behind a paywall, only given to donators. It has come to the point where SBA 1.5 has very few important features that haven't been replaced/outshined by other mods, and the same is mostly true with the 1.6 betas. The mod has begun to feel like a cash grab in which no development is made but people only buy for its well known name. Therefore, I plan to make an alternatives list to help prevent people for paying for something that doesn't recieve updates. This will be split into two sections, one for 1.6 features, and one for 1.5 features (for those who want to completely remove SBA - note: many of these features simply won't have alternatives).

First thoughts: a lot of features have been disabled wow. a lot of the remaining features i dont know of any alternatives, but most of them are also useless. many hud things can be replaced with apec/sbhud
